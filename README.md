# 🛡️ Penetration-Testing-on-DVWA

This repository contains a comprehensive **web application security assessment and threat mapping report** for **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**.

DVWA is an intentionally vulnerable web application designed for learning and practicing web application security testing. This project simulates **real-world attack scenarios** aligned with the **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** and demonstrates how common flaws are identified, exploited, analyzed, and mitigated in a controlled environment.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Identified Vulnerabilities

### 🔐 DVWA Vulnerabilities

## 🔐 DVWA Vulnerabilities

| # | Vulnerability | Severity | Impact  | Mitigation  |
|---|--------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | SQL Injection | High | Allows attackers to bypass authentication, extract sensitive database data, and manipulate backend records. | Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, and strict input validation. |
| 2 | Blind SQL Injection | High | Enables silent extraction of sensitive database information through response timing without visible errors. | Implement secure query handling, parameterized queries, and monitor abnormal response delays. |
| 3 | Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Medium | Leads to persistent execution of malicious scripts, resulting in session hijacking and credential theft. | Sanitize user input and apply proper output encoding before rendering content. |
| 4 | Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Medium | Allows execution of malicious scripts via crafted links, enabling phishing and session compromise. | Encode all reflected input and validate request parameters strictly. |
| 5 | DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Medium | Causes client-side script execution, leading to browser-based session and data compromise. | Avoid unsafe JavaScript methods and sanitize input before DOM insertion. |
| 6 | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Low–Medium | Forces authenticated users to perform unauthorized actions without their knowledge. | Implement anti-CSRF tokens and validate request origin and intent. |
